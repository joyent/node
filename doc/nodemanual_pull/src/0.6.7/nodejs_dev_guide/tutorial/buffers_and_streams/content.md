# Buffers and Streams

To gain a true mastery over Node.js, you'll need to deal with buffers and streams at some point in your development lifecycle. Although they're grouped together here, they're not exactly related.

Buffers are a concept dealing with raw data, not strings or objects or things of that sort. Meanwhile, streams _are_ objects, but they're more closely related to the operations you perform on them, and the ways you manipulate your data. Thus, you could use streams to more efficiently move a buffer from one location to another.

Confused? Don't worry&mdash;hopefully the tutorials will help straighten things out.
