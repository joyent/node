/**
streams.ReadableStream@close()

Emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed. Not all streams emit this.  For example, an incoming HTTP request don't emit `close`.

**/ 


/**
streams.ReadableStream@data(data)
- data (Buffer | String):  The data being emitted

The `data` event emits either a `Buffer` (by default) or a string if `setEncoding()` was previously used on the stream.

**/ 


/**
streams.ReadableStream@end()

Emitted when the stream has received an EOF (FIN in TCP terminology). Indicates that no more `data` events will happen. If the stream is also writable, it may be possible to continue writing.

**/ 


/**
streams.ReadableStream@error()

Emitted if there was an error receiving data.
**/ 


/**
streams.ReadableStream@pipe(src)
- src (streams.ReadableStream): The readable stream

Emitted when the stream is passed to a readable stream's pipe method.

**/ 


/**
streams.ReadableStream.destroy() -> Void

Closes the underlying file descriptor. The stream will not emit any more events.
**/ 


/**
streams.ReadableStream.destroySoon()-> Void

After the write queue is drained, close the file descriptor.

**/ 


/**
streams.ReadableStream.pause()-> Void

Pause any incoming `'data'` events.

**/


/**
streams.ReadableStream.pipe(destination [, options]) -> streams
- destination (streams.WritableStream):  The WriteStream to connect to
- options (Object):  Any optional commands to send

This is the `Stream.prototype()` method available on all `Stream` objects. It connects this read stream to a `destination`. Incoming data on this stream is then written to `destination`. The destination and source streams are kept in sync by Node.js pausing and resuming as necessary.

This function returns the `destination` stream.

By default, `end()` is called on the destination when the source stream emits `end`, so that `destination` is no longer writable. Pass `{ end: false }` into `options` to keep the destination stream open.

#### Example 

Emulating the Unix `cat` command:

    process.stdin.resume(); // process.stdin is paused by default, so we need to start it up
    process.stdin.pipe(process.stdout); // type something into the console & watch it repeat

This keeps `process.stdout` open so that "Goodbye" can be written at the end.

    process.stdin.resume();

    process.stdin.pipe(process.stdout, { end: false });

    process.stdin.on("end", function() {
      process.stdout.write("Goodbye\n");
    });

/** related to: streams.ReadableStream.data
streams.ReadableStream.setEncoding(encoding)
- encoding (String): The encoding to use; this can be `'utf8'`, `'ascii'`, or `'base64'`.

Makes the `data` event emit a string instead of a `Buffer`.

**/ 


/**
streams.ReadableStream.resume() -> Void

Resumes the incoming `'data'` events after a `pause()`.
