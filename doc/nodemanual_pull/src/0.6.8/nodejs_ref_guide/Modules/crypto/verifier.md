/** section: Crypto
  * class verifier
  *
  * This class is used to verify signed certificates for OpenSSL. It can be created as a returned value from [[crypto.createVerifier `crypto.createVerifier()`]].
  *
  *
  *
#### Example


	var s1 = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA1')
             .update('Test123')
             .sign(keyPem, 'base64');
	var verified = crypto.createVerify('RSA-SHA1')
                   .update('Test')
                   .update('123')
                   .verify(certPem, s1, 'base64');
	assert.strictEqual(verified, true, 'sign and verify (base 64)');

/**
verifier.verify(object, signature, [signature_format='binary']) -> Boolean
- object (String) : A string containing a PEM encoded object, which can be one of the following: an RSA public key, a DSA public key or an X.509 certificate
- signature (String): The previously calculated signature for the data
- signature_format (String): The format of the signature; can be `'binary'`, `'hex'`, or `'base64'`

Returns `true` or `false` depending on the validity of the signature for the data and public key.

<Note>The `verifier` object can't be used after the `verify()` method has been called.</Note>

/** chainable
verifier.update(data) -> verifier
- data (String): The data to use for an update

Updates the verifier object with data. This can be called many times with new data as it is streamed.
