## Crypto

Use `require('crypto')` to access this module.

The crypto module requires OpenSSL to be available on the underlying platform.
It offers a way of encapsulating secure credentials to be used as part
of a secure HTTPS net or http connection.

It also offers a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash and hmac methods.

### crypto.createCredentials(details)

Creates a credentials object, with the optional details being a dictionary with keys:

* `key` : a string holding the PEM encoded private key
* `cert` : a string holding the PEM encoded certificate
* `ca` : either a string or list of strings of PEM encoded CA certificates to trust.

If no 'ca' details are given, then node.js will use the default publicly trusted list of CAs as given in
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt>.


### crypto.createHash(algorithm)

Creates and returns a hash object, a cryptographic hash with the given algorithm
which can be used to generate hash digests.

`algorithm` is dependent on the available algorithms supported by the version
of OpenSSL on the platform. Examples are `'sha1'`, `'md5'`, `'sha256'`, `'sha512'`, etc.
On recent releases, `openssl list-message-digest-algorithms` will display the available digest algorithms.

Example: this program that takes the sha1 sum of a file

    var filename = process.argv[2];
    var crypto = require('crypto');
    var fs = require('fs');

    var shasum = crypto.createHash('sha1');

    var s = fs.ReadStream(filename);
    s.on('data', function(d) {
      shasum.update(d);
    });

    s.on('end', function() {
      var d = shasum.digest('hex');
      console.log(d + '  ' + filename);
    });

### hash.update(data)

Updates the hash content with the given `data`.
This can be called many times with new data as it is streamed.

### hash.digest(encoding='binary')

Calculates the digest of all of the passed data to be hashed.
The `encoding` can be `'hex'`, `'binary'` or `'base64'`.


### crypto.createHmac(algorithm, key)

Creates and returns a hmac object, a cryptographic hmac with the given algorithm and key.

`algorithm` is dependent on the available algorithms supported by OpenSSL - see createHash above.
`key` is the hmac key to be used.

### hmac.update(data)

Update the hmac content with the given `data`.
This can be called many times with new data as it is streamed.

### hmac.digest(encoding='binary')

Calculates the digest of all of the passed data to the hmac.
The `encoding` can be `'hex'`, `'binary'` or `'base64'`.
