Node-gyp is a utility that helps the node module’s project generation.
Node-gyp requires the "NODE_ROOT" enviroment variable to point to the node's source directory (the one that contains the src, deps and tools folders). 
Usage
-----
* On windows, node-gyp can have up to two arguments, which are optional:
  node-gyp [gyp-filename] [make]
    gyp-filename: is the gyp file that will be processed (it must have a .gyp extension)
    make: this is a command that dictates node-gyp to build the module using visual studio’s msbuild

* On linux and mac, node-gyp has only one optional argument:
  node-gyp [gyp-filename]
    gyp-filename: is the gyp file that will be processed
  
  In order to build the generated Makefile, do a simple make. You may aggregate the commands by posting:
  node-gyp && build
