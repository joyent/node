This test currently uses node-waf. This should change in the near future.

To run the tests, first do a `make install` in Node (use 
`configure --prefix=...` as usual to specify prefix) and then in the
current directory:

    PREFIX_NODE=<node-install-path> make

where `node-install-path` is the install prefix for Node.
